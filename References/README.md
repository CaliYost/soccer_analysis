### After clicking "Add file" and "Create new file", what is the next step to make this new directory?

##### Write <mark>References</mark>.
If you write References, this would save as a new file called References in the current directory.

##### Write <mark>References/</mark>.
GitHub won't allow you to make a commit as this syntax creates a new directory that would be empty.

##### Write <mark>References/README.md</mark>.
Perfect! Adding a new directory in GitHub requires the creation of a file inside the new directory, so it's common to create a README.md file during this process.

##### You can't create a new directory in a GitHub repo.
It is possible to create a new directory, but there are a couple of steps required.



### You navigate to README.md in the References directory and press the trash icon:

![trash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a629dc-601b-464e-b248-e401279d7a90)

### What else do you need to do to remove this file?

##### Add a commit message and make a commit.
